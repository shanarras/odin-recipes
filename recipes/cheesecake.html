<h1> Mini Basque Cheesecakes </h1>
<img src="../images/cheesecake.jpg" alt="cheesecake" width="25%">

<p> During one afternoon, I was craving cheesecake, but did not have enough cream cheese. Fortunately, I discovered this recipe by <a href="https://zhangcatherine.com/"> Catherine Zhang </a> that only required a few ingredients. I was also curious about how a basque cheesecake tastes like and thought this small serving recipe was perfect for a first attempt at baking it. It was quite simple to make and it was so scrumptious! </p>

</ol>
