<p> Madeleines were always a staple during our Costco runs. The ones in the plastic tin were yummy and sold at good value. I wanted to make them myself to save myself gas (and money in the future heh). I went on Amazon and impulsively bought a madeleine pan. These madeleines were so easy to make that I don't think I'll be getting those store-bought madeleines any time soon.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
    <li> 3 eggs </li>
    <li> 130g (2/3 cup) sugar </li>
    <li> 7.5ml (1 1/2 tsp) orange zest </li>
    <li> 120g (1 cup) flour </li>
    <li> 5ml (1 tsp) baking powder </li>
    <li> 1.25ml (1/4 tsp) salt </li>
    <li> 60ml (6 tbsp) melted butter </li>
    <li> 7g (1 tbsp) powdered sugar </li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>

<ol> 
    <li> Beat eggs with sugar until pale yellow. Add the orange zest. </li>
    <li> Whisk together dry ingredients. Add to the egg mixture until just combined. Add melted butter. </li>
    <li> Refrigerate batter for at least 1 hour or overnight. </li>
    <li> Preheat oven to 176°C (350F°). </li>
    <li> Lightly coat a non-stick Madeleine pan with baking spray.
    <li> Spoon 1 tablespoon (15ml) of batter into the center of the well and don't touch it. It will spread out by itself and keep a more uniform shape that way.  </li>
    <li> Bake 7-8 mins until slightly golden around edges and centers look set and a slight hump has appeared. Allow to cool slightly and remove from the tin. </li>
    <li> Once cooled completely, dust with powdered sugar and serve. </li>
    </li>
</ol>
